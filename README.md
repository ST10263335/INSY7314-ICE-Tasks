To run the full Lab Guide project, begin by opening a terminal and navigating into the Backend folder with cd Backend, then install the required dependencies using npm install and start the backend server with npx nodemon server.mjs, which will keep the server running and automatically restart it when changes are made. Once the backend is running, open a new terminal window or tab, move into the frontend folder with cd frontend, install its dependencies using npm install, and then launch the frontend development server with npm start; this will open the application in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000, allowing you to interact with the frontend while the backend handles API requests in the background.
